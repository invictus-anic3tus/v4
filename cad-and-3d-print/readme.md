# CAD Files

This is the directory where you can find all the CAD files associated with the v4. Keep in mind that all of these files are a work in progress, and haven't been very finely tuned. However, they should still work.

You can find the 3D print files in the sub-files of the 3D Print directory in .stl format. The file name will have instructions as to what filament and basic settings to use, as does the readme in that folder.
